# CashRegister

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.1.

## Development Server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Setup and Testing

Run `npm install` to install dependencies. The easiest way to test the code would be to run `ng serve -o`. You may also need to allow pop-ups on localhost in order for the results file to download.

## Notes

99% of the magic happens in src/app/calculator/calculator.component. I chose to use Angular as opposed to a serverside language because I wanted to design the project in such a way that it functions as a utility tool for the customer. This code could easily be ported to accept files or JSON data through an API and run on the server as opposed to the client.
