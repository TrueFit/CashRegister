Feel free to use whichever input you would like, but I provided the one I used during development (input.txt).

I would normally separate out business logic into another service DLL of some form; however, I did not want to over complicate the project for such a simple problem, so I did not go down the road of an n-tier application. 

I do have an example of an n-tier application I am currently working on if you would like to see it.

If you have any questions or would like anything else from me, please feel free to contact me.

Thank you, 

Cheers
